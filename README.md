## Hi there, I'm Matthew! 👋

I'm glad you found your way to my profile page!

### A little bit about me
- I enjoy working with C#/.NET, it's where I got my start after all!
- I was studying physics in school, and I love to solve problems!
- I have a dog, Nina, who sighs at me when I write bad code.
